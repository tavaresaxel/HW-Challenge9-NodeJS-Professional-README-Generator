## Tests

Best way to test the project and make sure the README is being created and populating the correct information is by doing a trial run. On the  first launch just type a random letter to answer the questions all the way down until you see success. After that make sure the README is being generated in the output file and open the read me in preview to see if the information is being populated correctly.
